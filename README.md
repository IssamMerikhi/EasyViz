# EasyViz

EasyViz is a little App which provides the user a clear and simple comprehension of his data. Ready to launch your business !

The App : [EasyViz](https://issammerikhi.shinyapps.io/easyviz/)

# Documentation

EasyViz is your new little business technology. If you want to **clearly** look and understand your data you just have to _UPLOAD your CSV file_ naviguate accros the categories :


- Density
- Heatmap
- Histograms
- Network

The app has been created to be user friendly. In this way, anyone who wants to visualise his data can do it very easily and _fastly_.

## Usage

The App has been made the simplest possible. The user must opload his data and then plays with the categories to choose the graph we want to show.

As example, the user can upload his CSV file via the upload button. Once the data loaded, the user can plays with differents types of visualisation.
To respect the spirit of a simple and friendly user project, I don't had button to choose range for interval and other kind of stuff.
For the tutorial, I displayed the well known iris dataset.
